# VAST Extension 1.0: All Versions

As CTV and digital video environments converge, we understand the need for a more flexible ability to standardize within currently used VAST specifications. This repository will host and provide implementation details for supporting important information about video ads as they move through the supply chain. The first set of extensions pull from some of the key features of VAST 4.x and ensure that there are standardized extensions for passing the data in the more commonly used VAST 2.x and 3.x.

To propose an extension, email [support@iabtechlab.com](support@iabtechlab.com) with “VAST Extension Proposal” in the subject line. If you are an IAB Tech Lab member participating in any of the working groups, you can work with your group lead to submit your proposal. Please provide a background for your proposal and implementation details.
